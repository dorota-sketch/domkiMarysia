What Are Typical Returns for a 35 m² Tiny House Investment?
Introduction

Investment in small modular houses with an area of approximately 35 m² (377 sq ft) has become one of the hottest trends in the Polish tourist real estate market. In an era of growing interest in domestic tourism and the search for alternative forms of accommodation, compact vacation homes offer attractive returns on investment with a relatively low entry threshold. But is this really a profitable business? Let's look at specific numbers and market analyses.

Concrete Numbers: How Much Can You Earn from a 35 m² Tiny House?
Basic Financial Data According to Domki Marysia

One of the leading producers of small modular houses in Poland is Domki Marysia, which specializes in constructions up to 35 m². The company presents very specific data regarding the profitability of such investments:

Key Financial Parameters:

Investment cost: from 220,000 PLN (~$55,000 USD) for the Marysia 01 model to 300,000 PLN (~$75,000 USD) for a fully equipped house
Potential annual income: over 70,000 PLN (~$17,500 USD)
Payback period: approximately 3-4 years
Monthly income: over 6,000 PLN (~$1,500 USD) with the right rental strategy

This means that an investment of 300,000 PLN can generate an annual return of 23-25%, which is significantly higher than traditional forms of savings or long-term rental residential property investments.

Cost and Revenue Structure

Initial Costs:

Modular house (developer standard): 220,000 - 266,000 PLN
Finishing (painting, flooring, bathroom): 20,000 - 40,000 PLN
Furnishing (furniture, appliances): 15,000 - 30,000 PLN
Foundation: 10,000 - 25,000 PLN
Utilities (connections): 15,000 - 40,000 PLN
TOTAL: 280,000 - 400,000 PLN (~$70,000 - $100,000 USD)

Annual Operating Costs:

Heating: 1,000 - 2,000 PLN per year (thanks to excellent insulation)
Electricity: 1,500 - 3,000 PLN
Water and sewage: 1,000 - 2,000 PLN
Cleaning and maintenance: 5,000 - 10,000 PLN
Marketing and booking portals: 3,000 - 6,000 PLN
Insurance: 1,500 - 3,000 PLN
TOTAL operating costs: 13,000 - 26,000 PLN per year (~$3,250 - $6,500 USD)
Profit Maximization Strategies
Difference in Capacity and Rental Price

According to Domki Marysia data, the difference between a 4-person and 6-person house can have fundamental significance for profitability:

4-person house: rental price 400-600 PLN/night in season
6-person house: rental price 700-900 PLN/night in season
Difference: up to 300 PLN daily at peak season

Thanks to thoughtful design with a mezzanine, houses with an area of 35 m² can accommodate up to 6 people, which significantly increases earning potential. In practice, this means that choosing a larger model can shorten the investment payback period by up to a year.

Year-Round vs. Seasonal Rental

Seasonal Scenario (May-September, 150 days):

Average occupancy: 70%
Days rented: 105
Average price: 600 PLN/night
Revenue: 63,000 PLN
Operating costs: 15,000 PLN
Net profit: 48,000 PLN

Year-Round Scenario (365 days):

Average occupancy: 50%
Days rented: 180
Average price: 450 PLN/night (lower off-season)
Revenue: 81,000 PLN
Operating costs: 20,000 PLN
Net profit: 61,000 PLN

Year-round rental requires better insulation and heating, but modular houses from Domki Marysia are designed for year-round use, with excellent insulation and efficient heating.

Factors Affecting Profitability
1. Location

The best results are achieved by houses located in:

Seaside towns: 80-90% occupancy in season
Mountain resorts: 70-85% occupancy, often with good winter results
By Masurian lakes: 75-85% in summer season
Near tourist attractions: 60-75% year-round
2. Finishing Standard

Houses in higher standard allow for:

Higher daily rates (by 20-40%)
Better reviews and guest repeatability
Higher occupancy in mid-season
Possibility of positioning as "premium"
3. Marketing and Online Availability

Professional photos, presence on booking portals (Booking.com, Airbnb, local platforms) and own website can increase occupancy by 30-50%.

Thanks to funding, the actual equity contribution can be significantly reduced, which improves return on investment indicators.

Tax Optimization

Income from renting vacation houses can be taxed in several ways:

Lump Sum on Recorded Income
Rate: 8.5% for income up to 100,000 PLN, then 12.5%
Simplest form
No possibility of deducting costs
Business Activity – Tax Scale
Possibility to deduct all costs
Rates: 12% and 32%
Greater flexibility
Business Activity – Linear Tax
Rate: 19%
For higher incomes

Example: with annual income of 80,000 PLN and costs of 20,000 PLN:

Lump sum 8.5%: 6,800 PLN tax
Tax scale (12%): 7,200 PLN tax (at 60,000 PLN income)
Linear tax (19%): 11,400 PLN tax
Challenges and Risks
Seasonality

In many locations, 70-80% of annual income is concentrated in the May-September period. A year-round rental strategy requires:

Excellent thermal insulation
Efficient heating system
Off-season attractions
Appropriate marketing strategy
Competition

Growing popularity of short-term rentals means greater competition. Standing out requires:

Exceptional location
High standard
Excellent reviews
Unique features (jacuzzi, sauna, view)
Management

Short-term rental involves:

Frequent cleaning and preparation
Guest communication
Reservations and payments
Maintenance and repairs

Many people use management companies, which cost 15-25% of revenue, but significantly simplify operations.

1. Is a 35 m² house enough for a family with children?

Answer: Yes, with the right design with a mezzanine, a 35 m² house can accommodate up to 6 people.

The key is thoughtful placement of functions and multifunctional furniture.

5. How long does it take to build a 35 m² modular house?

Answer: The entire process from signing the contract to receiving the finished house takes 2-3 months. Most importantly, on-site assembly takes only 4 days! This is a huge difference compared to traditional construction, where completion can take a year or longer. The speed comes from prefabrication – the house is built in controlled factory conditions.

6. Can I expand a 35 m² house in the future?

Answer: Yes, modular technology enables future expansion. Domki Marysia designs houses with potential expansion in mind, so you can add more modules and increase usable area. This is a flexible solution that grows with your needs or business development.

7. What documents are needed to set up a 35 m² house?

Answer: In most cases, a construction notification is sufficient, which significantly simplifies the administrative process. A building permit is not required, which means faster investment start. Domki Marysia offers help with all formalities – from preparing documentation to submitting appropriate applications.

8. How much does a complete, ready-to-live-in 35 m² house cost?

Answer: The total cost of a "turnkey" investment is 280,000 - 400,000 PLN (~$70,000 - $100,000 USD), including:

House in developer standard: 220,000 - 266,000 PLN
Finishing: 20,000 - 40,000 PLN
Furnishing: 15,000 - 30,000 PLN
Foundation: 10,000 - 25,000 PLN
Utilities: 15,000 - 40,000 PLN

The Marysia 01 model starts at 220,000 PLN, and Marysia 07 from 266,000 PLN in developer standard.

9. Can I get a grant for building a vacation house?

Answer: Yes! In 2025, many funding programs are available:

LEADER Program: up to 500,000 PLN (coverage up to 85% of costs)
LGD: up to 150,000 PLN (coverage up to 65-80%)
District Labor Office for unemployed: up to 54,000 PLN
PFRON: up to 134,000 PLN

Thanks to grants, you can significantly reduce equity contribution and improve investment profitability. Preparing a solid business plan and meeting program requirements is crucial.

10. What location ensures the best return on investment?

Answer: The best results are achieved by houses in:

Seaside locations: 80-90% occupancy in season, high rates
Mountain resorts: 70-85% occupancy, good winter and summer results
By Masurian lakes: 75-85% in summer season
Near tourist attractions: 60-75% year-round

Most important location features: proximity to attractions, good access, beautiful natural surroundings.

11. Does renting a house require running a business?

Answer: It depends on the scale and method of rental. Occasional rental of private property can be taxed with a lump sum on recorded income (8.5%). However, systematic rental, especially of several properties, usually requires business registration. It's best to consult with a tax advisor to choose the most beneficial form of taxation.

12. What are the biggest challenges in short-term rental?

Answer: Main challenges are:

Seasonality: 70-80% of income in May-September
Management: frequent cleaning, guest communication, reservations
Competition: growing number of offers requires standing out
Maintenance: greater wear than with long-term rental
Reviews: crucial for success, difficult to control

The solution may be a management company (15-25% of revenue) or your own service system.

13. Can a 35 m² house also be used for personal vacation?

Answer: Of course! Many owners reserve the house for themselves for a few weeks a year, combining pleasure with profit. The rest of the time the property generates rental income. This is a popular strategy that allows you to have your own vacation spot and simultaneously earn money most of the year.

14. What is the difference between a 4-person and 6-person house in terms of earnings?

Answer: The difference is significant! A 6-person house (with mezzanine) can cost 300 PLN more per day in season than a 4-person house. In practice, this means:

4-person house: 400-600 PLN/night → ~50,000 PLN per year
6-person house: 700-900 PLN/night → ~70,000 PLN per year
Additional income: 15,000 - 20,000 PLN per year

Investment in a larger model pays back faster, often a year earlier.

15. Is modular technology as durable as traditional?

Answer: Yes, and often even more so! Domki Marysia offers:

10-year warranty on wooden structure
5 years on all production materials
Production in controlled factory conditions (better quality)
Scandinavian C24 wood dried to 15-18% moisture
No problems with fungi and insects

Precise prefabrication often provides better quality than traditional construction dependent on weather and variable quality of construction crew work.
